        "### Math\n",
        "Linear Algebra concepts like Matrix Multiplication, vector addition, dot products, etc. We'll be going over concepts from Multivariable Calculus like gradients and partial derivatives, but we'll also give you the Single Variable Calculus equivalent.\n",

        "* We use the print() function to output things. If you're unsure what this means, don't worry about it - take it as a black box and just know you can use the print() function to output things in later exercises.\n",

        "   *   **string:** a sequence of characters. We usually put strings in double or single quotes, ex. \"Artificial intelligence probably won't end the world\", 'Andrew Ng is cool.'\n",

        "* If you're more familiar with coding, Python is a relatively simple language - a quick google search will give you a rundown of the basics (ex. [this](https://www.stavros.io/tutorials/python/)) and then googling a little more to determine specifics, e.g. syntax questions, ought to do the job. \n",

Check out ML legend Andrew Ng's [video on matrix-vector multiplication](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/machine-learning/matrix-vector-multiplication-aQDta), which is part of his Linear Algebra Review series.
